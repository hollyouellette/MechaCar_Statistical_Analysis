# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

  _Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?_

- vehicle_length & ground clearance

  _Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?_

No, the slope is not 0 based on the rejection of the null hypothesis due to the P value as well as 
coefficient of determination and represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points - strong positive correlation 

  _Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?_
  
  Yes it does 71% - null hypothesis rejected 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
