## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

  _Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?_

- vehicle_length & ground clearance

  _Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?_

No, the slope is not 0 based on the rejection of the null hypothesis due to the P value as well as 
coefficient of determination and represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points - strong positive correlation 

  _Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?_
  
  Yes it does 71% - null hypothesis rejected
